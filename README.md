This code is the starter code for Assignment 2 of the 2023 spring offering of the Computer Architecture course (2202-COL216).

## Files
- `MIPS_Processor.hpp` contains the implementation of the instruction parser and a non-pipelined implementation of the MIPS processor.
- `sample.cpp` contains a sample usage of the `MIPS_Architecture` struct.
- `sample.asm` contains a sample assembly program that can be run on the processor.

## Usage
After cloning the repository, run the following commands to compile and run the sample program:
```bash
$ make all
$ ./sample sample.asm
```
